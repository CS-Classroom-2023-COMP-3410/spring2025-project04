Virtual Pet Dashboard - Interactive Web Assignment
---

**Objective**:

Create an interactive dashboard where users can engage with a virtual pet. They should have the ability to feed, play with, and put the pet to sleep, and view the pet's current mood and health status. Your task involves utilizing HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing interactivity and dynamic changes.

This project aims to fortify your understanding of:
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Basic State Management with Javascript Data Structures
- Time-based actions using JavaScript’s `setTimeout` or `setInterval`

**Requirements**:

1. **Pet Representation**: 
    - Utilize a simple HTML element, such as a `div`, with a background color or image to represent the pet.
    - Alter the color or image in alignment with the pet's mood or health.

2. **Interactive Buttons**:
    - Incorporate buttons allowing users to interact with the pet, such as "Feed," "Play," and "Sleep."

3. **Status Indicators**:
    - Exhibit the pet's mood and health status, for instance, happy, hungry, sleepy, etc.
    - Keep track of at least 3 different kinds of status.
    - Utilize simple text elements or graphical indicators.

4. **Interactivity and Dynamic Updates**:
    - Implement event listeners, allowing button clicks to update the pet's status.
    - Integrate dynamic changes using `setTimeout` and `setInterval`, changing the pet’s mood and health over time, prompting user interaction to maintain the pet’s wellbeing.

5. **CSS Styling**: Make your dashboard visually appealing, using whatever CSS techniques you'd like (including frameworks). 

6. **Persistence with `localStorage`**: Ensure the pet's status is retained even after a page refresh.

**Bonus Feature**:

1. **Animations and Effects**: Integrate simple animations or effects correlating with user interactions, like a joyful shake of the pet when happy - look into jQueryUI (https://jqueryui.com/effect/).

**Submission Instructions**:

- Include your `index.html`, `styles.css`, and any JavaScript files in your git repository. Also please host your website on GitHub pages as shown in class, and submit the link on Canvas.

**Assessment**:

1. Submissions will be evaluated based on the fulfillment of the mentioned requirements, the execution of interactivity and dynamic updates, and alignment with the assignment’s objective.
  
2. You might be requested to discuss your code and the rationale behind your design and interactive decisions.

**Development Guidance**:

1. Start by drafting the HTML to outline the basic structural components including the pet representation, interactive buttons, and status indicators.
  
2. Progress to stylize your dashboard with CSS, enhancing its visual appeal.
  
3. Implement interactivity and dynamic changes with JavaScript. Define variables representing the pet's current status, and utilize event listeners to update the variables and HTML elements in response to user interactions and time-based actions.
